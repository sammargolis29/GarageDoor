# Assignment 6 Questions

Please answer the following questions.  There are no "wrong" answers, but:
  * Some will help us understand your work habits,
  * Some will help us understand your work, and
  * Some may help you identify deficiencies in your work.

***Q1.0 Can you describe any errors or bugs that you found particularly time consuming or challenging?***
Our original design was not as responsive as we had hoped. Also our settings button did not show up originally.

***Q1.1 If applicable, were there any special programming techniques or tools you used to assist you with the bugs/challenges in the previous question?***
We took advantage of the feature in the console where you can view your page on smaller screens ie a phone

***Q1.2 Errors/bugs are unavoidable, but in hindsight are there any techniques/approaches that you could have used (but didn't) that would have helped you with the bugs/challenges?***
We probably could have found a phone to test it on earlier, one that had the phone gap app

***Q1.3 Were there any significant misunderstandings (i.e., not a typo) that deterred your progress on this?  If so, can you describe them?***

***Q2 Do you have any suggestions that would help future students with this assignment?***
I would recommend ensuring that your design is responsive from the beginning

***Q3.0 If you worked in a group, did you use pair programming?***
Yes

***3.1 If you didn't use pair programming, skip to question 3.2.  If you did, in the following table give each person's name and an estimate of the percent of total time they spent as a "driver":***

| Name  |  % of Time as Driver |
|:------|:---------------------|
|  Soraya Moss  | 50%                  |
|  Sam Margolis  | 50%                  |

***Q3.2 If you used pair programming, skip this question.  If you didn't, explain how you divided up the work and how each person contributed:***

***Q4. Assignment Checklist.  Below is a Markdown style Task List. The Tasks correspond to many of the major features of the assignment. Filling in the checklist will help ensure that you have completed many of the major elements of the assignment (although it does not cover every point possible)***
